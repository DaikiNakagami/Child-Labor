        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        
        <p>Information on child labor and forced labor in this app is taken from three USDOL reports, known as the TDA Report, TVPRA List, and EO List. For more information about these reports, see . This page describes the data collection and data analysis methods used to produce the reports.</p>
        
        <h2>TDA Report</h2>
        <p>Information was gathered for the TDA report through desk research, U.S. embassy reporting, and limited field work. Information was also received from some foreign governments. Information was also collected from U.S. Government-funded technical assistance and field research projects. ILAB did not use information that is unavailable to the public, such as government-classified information. ILAB used the criteria of nature, date and source of information as well as extent of corroboration to determine what should be included in the TDA report. ILAB also assessed the extent to which beneficiary countries advanced efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor during the reporting period. Countries were assessed as having made Significant, Moderate, Minimal or No Advancement, or No Assessment. In preparing the assessments, ILAB evaluated country efforts against criteria laid out in the TDA Conference Committee report.

        <h2>TVPRA List</h2>
        <p>ILAB used similar data collection methods to prepare the TVPRA list as the TDA report. ILAB also applied similar criteria to judge the quality of information. ILAB sometimes based a determination to add a good on a single, representative survey when it was confident in the rigor of the methodology and execution. In addition, ILAB considered whether the information about the use of child labor or forced labor in the production of a good(s) warrants a determination that the incidence of such practices is significant in the country in question. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/pdf/TVPRA_Report2014.pdf">TVPRA report introduction</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>EO List</h2>
        <p>ILAB used similar data collection methods to prepare the EO list as the TVPRA list. ILAB also applied similar criteria to judge the quality of information. In addition, ILAB considered whether the information about the use of forced or indentured child labor involved more than an isolated incident; and whether recent and credible efforts are being made to address forced or indentured child labor in a particular country and industry.‚Äù For more information, see the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/pdf/EO_Report_2014.pdf">EO report introduction</a>.</p>

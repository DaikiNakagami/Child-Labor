        <h1>About This App</h1>
        
        <h2>What is this app?</h2>
        <p>Sweat &amp; Toil is a comprehensive resource developed by the U.S. government   documenting child labor and forced labor worldwide. This app contains information on goods produced by child labor or forced labor and the latest U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) findings on the worst forms of child labor in 140 countries. It fits three information-packed reports the size of a phone book in the palm of your hand. Five things you can do with this app are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check countries’ efforts to eliminate child labor</li>
            <li>Find child labor data;</li>
            <li>Browse goods produced with child labor or forced labor;</li>
            <li>Review laws and ratifications; and</li>
            <li>See what governments can to do end child labor.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>How can I use this app?</h2>
        <p>Using this app can be a starting point to empower yourself with knowledge about child labor or forced labor around the world. Anyone with an interest in these issues – governments, businesses, academics, civil society, consumers – can use it as a source of information to begin asking questions, taking action, and demanding change. And because this app makes this information both portable and available offline for the first time, you can use it in any corner of the world, for on-the-ground engagement or education on these issues. We are also making the data available to developers to use in their own applications, data visualizations, and mashups with other data sets through our <a href="http://developer.dol.gov/child-labor">API</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>What is the purpose of these reports?</h2>
        <p>A starting point for action, these reports are intended to raise public awareness about child labor and forced labor around the world and to promote and inform efforts to address them. The research helps inform Congress and Executive Branch agencies that formulate labor and trade policy and is an important resource for USDOL in assessing future technical assistance and research priorities as it seeks to combat child labor around the world. It is also a valuable resource for foreign governments, researchers, advocacy organizations, and companies wishing to carry out risk assessments and engage in due diligence on labor rights in their supply chains.</p>
        
        <h2>Why isn’t every country in the world represented here?</h2>
        <p>This has to do with the data availability and the scope of Congressional mandates that govern USDOL’s reporting on these issues. For more information about these mandates and the three reports this app draws from, read our methodology page.</p>

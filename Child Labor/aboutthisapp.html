        <h1>About This App</h1>
        
        <h2>What is this app?</h2>
        <p>Sweat &amp; Toil is a comprehensive resource developed by the U.S. government   documenting child labor and forced labor worldwide. This app contains goods produced by child labor or forced labor and the latest U.S. Department of Labor findings on the worst forms of child labor, including assessments of laws on the books and actions on the ground, as well as suggested actions for addressing the worst forms of child labor in over 140 countries. It fits three information-packed reports the size of a phone book in the palm of your hand.</p>
        
        <h2>How can I use this app?</h2>
        <p>Anyone with a stake in these issues – governments, businesses, academics, civil society, consumers – can use this as a source of information, a tool for engagement, a catalyst for action, or fuel for further research. And because this app makes this information both portable and available offline for the first time, you can use it in any corner of the world, for on-the-ground engagement or education on these issues.</p>
        
        <h2>What is the purpose of these reports?</h2>
        <p>A starting point for action, these reports are intended to raise public awareness about child labor and forced labor around the world and to promote and inform efforts to address them. Our research helps inform Congress and Executive Branch agencies that formulate labor and trade policy and is an important resource for the Department of Labor in assessing future technical assistance and research priorities as it seeks to combat child labor around the world. It is also a valuable resource for foreign governments, researchers, advocacy organizations and companies wishing to carry out risk assessments and engage in due diligence on labor rights in their supply chains.</p>
        
        <h2>Why isn’t every country in the world represented here?</h2>
        <p>This has to do with the data availability and the scope of Congressional mandates that govern our reporting on these issues. For more information about these mandates and the three reports this app draws from, read our methodology page.</p>

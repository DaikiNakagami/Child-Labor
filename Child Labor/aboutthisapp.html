        <h1>About this app</h1>
        
        <p>This app contains information on international child labor and forced labor taken from three ILAB reports, the <em>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</em>, the <em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em> and the <em>List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor</em>. While an effort was made to capture important pieces of information, this app only contains a portion of the material in the reports. (View the full reports on the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/">webpage of the three reports</a>.)</p>
        <p>ILAB prepares the <em>Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor</em> report in accordance with the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA), which mandated the Secretary of Labor to report on certain trade beneficiary countriesâ€™ implementation of international commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The report covers 123 independent countries and 17 non-independent countries and territories. This app contains the following information from the TDA report:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>assessments of country efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor,</li>
            <li>suggested actions countries can take to further these efforts,</li>
            <li>statistics on child work and education, and</li>
            <li>status of country ratification of conventions and adoption of laws relevant to the worst forms of child labor.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ILAB prepares the <em>List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</em> in accordance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005. The TVPRA of 2005 requires ILAB to develop a list of goods from countries that it has reason to believe are produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards. The TVPRA list focuses on both children under 18 as well as adults. It contains information on 136 goods from 74 countries that ILAB has reason to believe are produced by forced labor, child labor or both.</p>
        <p>ILAB prepares the <em>List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor</em> in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 13126, <em>Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor</em>. EO 13126 mandates that the Department of Labor, in consultation and cooperation with the Departments of State and Homeland Security, publish a list of products identified by their country of origin that the three Departments have a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The EO list contains information on 35 products from 26 countries. For both the TVPRA list and the EO list, the app contains information on countries, exploitation types and goods, including by sector.</p>
